0.1.x - 0.2.0

- Rewrite the library to reuse wherever possible the libwpd types and  APIs.
- Rewrite the libwpg API to be similar to the libwpd API where the arguments
  are passed as pairs of attribute name and values.
- Convert the embedded text inside graphics.
- Remove implementation of stream abstraction class and use the libwpd'
  WPXInputStream implementations.

0.1.2 - 0.1.3

- in WPG2, pseudo-handle polyspline: since we dont manage to generate it, 
  we simply draw a polyline and wait for bug reports to give us some more
  information (Fridrich).
- change run-lenth decoding of bitmap code from using a manually allocated
  buffer to a std::vector based solution for both WPG1 and WP2 (Fridrich).
- robustness improvement of our bitmap parser when handling corrupted
  documents (Fridrich, sum1).
- when dumping binary objects and bitmaps in debug mode, don't crash when
  the current directory is not writable for the user (Fridrich).
- in WPG1 Bitmap decoding, handle also bitmaps with coulour depth 2 and 4,
  which allows the FINGER.WPG test file to unveil its attractions (Fridrich). 
- in WPG1, attempt to handle the embedded postscript (Fridrich).
- in WPG1, handle bezier curves (Fridrich).
- in WPG1, fix for pen styles (Fridrich).
- in WPG2, don't assume 1200 dpi for embedded objects if the document specifies
  a different one (Fridrich).
- in WPG2, don't try to handle embedded WPG fragments as binary documents, since
  nobody other out there handles them if we don't (Fridrich).
- in WPG2, add some useful dump and debug capabilities and fix a wrong seek.
- in spec file, require pkg-config (Fridrich).
- let autogen.sh not call configure at all (Fridrich).
- allow specifying the docdir and don't install documentation as executables (patch
  Michal Marek <mmarek@suse.cz>)

0.1.1 - 0.1.2
- Work around an issue with relative seeks backward and certain versions of libstdc++
  in the buffered stream implementation (Fridrich, sum1)
- Fix regression in decoding of bitmap in WPG2 files (Fridrich, sum1).
- Fix a bug in reading bitmap size in double precision WPG2 files (Fridrich, sum1).
- Remove some abuse of pointers in wpg2foo tools (Fridrich).
- Fix some signedness problems (Fridrich).
- Fix some array-out-of-bond errors in decoding of bitmap with corrupted
  WPG1 documents (Fridrich, sum1).
- Add some sanity checks (Fridrich).

0.1.0 - 0.1.1
- Make win32 crosscompilation very smooth (Fridrich)
- Implement win32 binary packaging using Makefile
- Compile fixes for gcc 4.3
- Fix a load of compiler warnings with Intel compiler, with Sun
  Studio,...
- Backport the bufferred file stream implementation from libwpd.
- Make autogen.sh accept glibtoolize as a valid incarnation of libtoolize
 
0.1.0 --> initial release
- proper recognition of WPG files from WPD files (headers are practically the same)
- initial WPG record support (lots of stuff is still unsupported)
