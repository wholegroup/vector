librevenge is a base library for writing document import filters. It has
interfaces for text documents, vector graphics, spreadsheets and presentations.

librevenge requires boost, zlib (optional, for the stream library) and
doxygen (optional) to build. Most up to date code is available from Git
repository at sourceforge.net
(https://sourceforge.net/p/libwpd/librevenge/). See
https://sourceforge.net/p/libwpd/wiki/librevenge/ for more information.

To build and install, simply do:
./autogen.sh # only needed if built from git checkout
./configure
make
su -c 'make install'

Alternatively, there are workspaces for various versions of MSVC in build/win32/
directory. Each of these workspaces contains a projects file to compile a
release version or a debug version of librevenge.

NOTE: Using the MSVC build system will result in a static library only. No dll
can be created yet using this build system.

The library is available under MPL 2.0.
