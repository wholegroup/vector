librevenge 0.0.2

- Better handling of invalid input in RVNGDirectoryStream functions.
- Add documentation for RVNGDirectoryStream.
- Add text:outline-level to allowed paragraph properties. This is to allow
  import libraries to handle headings properly.
- Properly handle units in all generators, instead of expecting everything is
  in inches.
- Implement open/closeGroup for RVNGSVGDrawingGenerator.
- Improve handling of layers in RVNGSVGPresentationGenerator.
- Handle master pages in RVNGSVGDrawingGenerator and
  RVNGSVGPresentationGenerator.
- Simple handling of tables in RVNGSVGDrawingGenerator and
  RVNGSVGPresentationGenerator: just create a text box for each cell.
- Fix return value of RVNGStringStream::seek when seeking to end.
- Fix some warnings found by Coverity.
- Use symbol visibility on Linux. The library only exports public functions
  now.
- Fix several crashes or hangs when reading broken OLE2 or Zip files, found
  with the help of american-fuzzy-lop.
- Add fo:language, fo:country and fo:script to allowed span properties.
- Handle headings in RVNGHTMLTextGenerator.

librevenge 0.0.1

- Fix license headers in some files.
- Export API symbols on windows.
- Really allow to disable build without streams and generators.
- Detect CppUnit in configure already.
- Drop dependency of librevenge-stream to Boost.Filesystem.
- Do not throw exception when constructing RVNGDirectoryStream for an unexistent
  directory. Instead, create a valid dummy stream that will respond negatively
  to all operations (for consistency with RVNGFileStream).
- Fix return type of RVNGBinaryData::getDataStream(). This change does affect
  neither API nor ABI.
- Add some documentation for RVNGBinaryData.
- Create a Coverity model covering the majority of librevenge data types, for
  the benefit of projects that use librevenge.
- Several minor improvements and fixes.
